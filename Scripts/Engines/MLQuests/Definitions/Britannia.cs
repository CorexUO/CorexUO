We had a little money set by, and she took it to a necromancer, who promised to restore my father to life. Well, he revived my father, all right, the cheat! Now my father is a walking corpse, a travesty . . . a monster. My mother is beside herself -- she won't eat, she can't sleep. I prayed at the shrine of Spirituality for guidance, and I must have fallen asleep. When I awoke, there was this basin of clear water. I cannot leave my mother, for I fear what she might do to herself. Could you take this to the graveyard, and give it to what is left of my father?

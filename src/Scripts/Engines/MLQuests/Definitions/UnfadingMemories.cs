Once, I loved a noble lady of gentleness and refinement, who possessed such beauty that I have found myself unable to love another to this day. But it was from afar that I admired her, for it is not for one so lowly as I to pay court to the likes of her. You have heard of the fair Thalia, Lady of Nujel'm? No? Well, she was my Muse, my inspiration, and when I heard she was to be married, I lost whatever pitiful talent I possessed. I felt I must compose a portrait of her, my masterpiece, or I would never be able to paint again. You, my friend, have helped me complete my work. Now I ask another favor of you. Will you take it to her as a wedding gift? She will probably reject it, but I must make the offer.
